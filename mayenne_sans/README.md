# Mayenne Sans

Mayenne Sans is a custom typeface designed by [Jérémy Landes](http://studiotriple.fr/) with an art direction by [Atelier Julian Legendre](http://www.atelierjulianlegendre.com) for the department of the [Mayenne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayenne), in the northwest France.

To renew the brand image of the department, Atelier Julian Legendre asked Jérémy Landes to draw a display font with his existing font [Jaune Grande](https://studiotriple.fr/travaux/typefaces/jaune/) as a starting point. To distinguish this new font from Jaune and make it more legible, it has been chosen to have big apertures and rounder curves. The resulting typeface is way friendlier and conveys the messages of the territory. Like its source, Mayenne Sans as a tremendous x-height with super short ascenders and descenders, allowing tight leading and making it useful for compact heading paragraphs.

From the beginning of the project, it has been decided that this typeface would be open-source, to ensure its future and to make it available for all the inhabitants and structures of the department.
